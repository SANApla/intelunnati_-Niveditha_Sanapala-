#Smart Mobile Phone Price Prediction using Machine Learning -
Whenever we plan to purchase any mobile phone ,we consider many factors like Camera,     Battery life, Memory etc. But the most important factor we should consider is whether the mobile phone we are going to purchase is worth the cost or not . As we donâ€™t have any resources to cross check the price, we tend to take wrong decision sometimes
Through this project, we will be able to solve this problem by  taking the historical data pertaining to the key features of smartphones along with its cost and develop a model that will predict the approximate price of the new smartphone with a reasonable accuracy
